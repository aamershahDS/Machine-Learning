# Machine-Learning
This project focuses on the classification of ECG signals to detect cardiac arrhythmias, a critical task in predictive healthcare. Leveraging machine learning algorithms, this model identifies patterns within ECG signals to distinguish between normal and abnormal heart rhythms, aiding in the early detection of potential heart issues.
